# AES Finder

AES Finder is a tool to read process memory and attempt to find aes keys stored in memory. This is based off of [AES Finder by mmozeiko](https://github.com/mmozeiko/aes-finder).

## Usage

```bash
cargo run firefox.exe
```

## Information
This is my first real project with Rust and is mainly a learning tool for me. Right now the project only finds all process id's from the process name.
